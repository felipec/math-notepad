Very simple [math.js](https://mathjs.org/) editor using [CodeJar](https://medv.io/codejar/) and
[highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).

This is a fork from [felipec/math-notepad](https://github.com/felipec/math-notepad) trying to show only important outputs and showing from which input it comes from. Also it shows the cases where the outputs show multiple lines.

You can try it online at https://dvd101x.github.io/math-notepad/

This is a simplified version of [Engineering-Solver](https://github.com/dvd101x/Engineering-Solver)
plus syntax highlighting.
